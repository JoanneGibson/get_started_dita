  <title>2.2.1 Isolation of genomic DNA from post mortem tissue</title>
  <conbody>
    <p>Genomic DNA was extracted from the post mortem tissue samples listed in Table 2.1 and 2.2 for
      both mutation analysis and X chromosome inactivation studies, using a modified version of
      Sambrook (Sambrook and Russell, 2001).</p>
    <p>DNA was isolated from the frontal and occipital cortices in each case, and parietal cortex,
      cerebellum, substantia nigra, thalamus, temporal cortex, and hippocampus subject to
      availability. The outer cortical layers were obtained using a scalpel and forceps whilst the
      specimen remained frozen on dry ice. </p>
